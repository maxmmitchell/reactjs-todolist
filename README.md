# CRUD Todo List

Very basic first app in React.JS
Served on [https://maxmm-reactjs-todos.netlify.app/](https://maxmm-reactjs-todos.netlify.app/)

## TODO for Todo List

- Persist edits in-progress
- Re-vamp page style to fit my preferences
- Retain order on edits
- Different color palletes (dark/light mode, at least)

## Acknowledgements
